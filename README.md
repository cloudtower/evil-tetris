# Tetris in terminal

This is an evil version of shkolovy's [classic tetris game](https://github.com/shkolovy/tetris-terminal) that tries to bully you whereever it can. Whenever there is a piece that you cannot fit anywhere, it will be given to you. Play and discover more of the annoying sh.t it throws at you!

There were also some small changes to make the game feel more similar to tetris-bsd.
